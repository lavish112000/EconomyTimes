<KeyTakeaways>
- IPO converts private company to public—founders dilute stake for capital, public gets ownership opportunity
- SEBI mandates 35% retail quota (applications ≤₹2 lakh) for fair distribution—but oversubscription often means lottery
- Book building determines price (95% of IPOs)—bids within price band decide final issue price, not company alone
- Grey Market Premium (GMP) is illegal indicator of listing sentiment—NOT a guarantee, purely speculative
- 60-70% of IPOs give negative returns in first year (historical data)—listing gains are exception, not rule
</KeyTakeaways>

## Introduction: The ₹2,00,000 Listing Day Dream (That Became a Nightmare)

**2021. Tech IPO Boom. Paytm IPO opens.**

**Amit, 32-year-old IT professional, sees everyone talking about IPOs.**

**The hype**:
- "Paytm is India's largest fintech!"
- "Grey market premium: +₹50 per share"
- "Friends made ₹30k-40k on Zomato IPO last month"
- "Apply maximum ₹2 lakh—guaranteed listing gains!"

**Amit's decision**:
- Applies for ₹2 lakh worth (maximum retail quota)
- Issue price: ₹2,150 per share
- Gets allotment: 7 shares (₹15,050 invested after pro-rata)
- **Dream**: Sell on listing day at ₹2,400, make ₹1,750 quick profit

**Listing Day (Nov 18, 2021)**:
- Opening price: ₹1,955 (9% BELOW issue price)
- Closes at: ₹1,564 (27% loss)
- Amit's ₹15,050 → ₹10,948
- **Loss: ₹4,102 (27%) in ONE day**

**18 months later (May 2023)**:
- Paytm trading at: ₹650
- Amit's investment: ₹4,550 (70% loss from issue price)
- **Total loss: ₹10,500 on ₹15,050 investment**

**What went wrong?**

Not that Paytm was a bad business (debatable, but that's not the point).

**The problem**:
- **Overvaluation**: Issue price ₹2,150 at 40x Price-to-Sales (when profitable companies trade at 5-10x)
- **Market timing**: Listed at peak valuations (Nov 2021), market crashed 6 months later
- **Blind application**: Amit didn't read DRHP, didn't understand business model, didn't check financials
- **"Listing gains" mentality**: Treated IPO like lottery, not investment

**Contrast: LIC IPO (May 2022)**

**Retail investors applied**:
- Issue price: ₹949
- Listing: ₹875 (8% loss)
- Current (2024): ₹950 (0% gain after 2.5 years)
- **Expected "guaranteed returns" from "India's largest insurance company" → Zero**

**Contrast: Successful IPO (Zomato, July 2021)**

**Those who got allotment**:
- Issue price: ₹76
- Listing: ₹116 (53% gain)
- Many sold immediately, booked profit
- Current (2025): ₹220 (189% gain from issue price)

**Lesson**: Those who HELD through volatility made real money. Listing gain sellers missed 3x returns.

**This article is NOT about**:
- Which IPOs to apply for (we don't give stock tips)
- How to predict listing gains (impossible)
- "Sure-shot" IPO strategies (don't exist)

**This article IS about**:
- How IPO process works in India (SEBI framework)
- What information to extract from DRHP
- How to evaluate IPO fundamentally (not speculatively)
- Risks most retail investors ignore
- Long-term investor perspective vs listing gain lottery

Let's understand the IPO machinery.

---

## 1. What is an IPO?

### Core Definition

**Initial Public Offering (IPO)** = First sale of company stock to the general public

**Before IPO** (Private Company):
- Owned by founders, angel investors, venture capital, private equity
- Shares NOT traded on stock exchange
- Limited shareholders (typically &lt;200)
- No SEBI disclosure requirements
- Valuation determined by private funding rounds

**After IPO** (Public Company):
- Owned by thousands/millions of shareholders
- Shares traded on NSE, BSE daily
- Unlimited shareholders
- Quarterly financial disclosure mandatory (SEBI)
- Valuation determined by market demand-supply

---

### Why Companies Go Public

**1. Raise Capital** (Primary Objective):
- Fund expansion (new plants, R&D, marketing)
- Repay debt (reduce interest burden)
- Working capital requirements

**Example** (Zomato IPO, 2021):
- Raised: ₹9,375 crore
- Use: ₹7,500 Cr for growth investments, ₹1,875 Cr for selling shareholder exit

**2. Provide Exit to Early Investors** (Offer For Sale - OFS):
- Venture capital/private equity want to cash out
- Founders want liquidity
- Employees with ESOPs get tradeable shares

**3. Brand Value & Credibility**:
- "Listed company" status enhances trust
- Easier to attract talent (stock options)
- Better negotiation with suppliers, customers

**4. Currency for Acquisitions**:
- Can issue shares to acquire other companies
- Stock-based mergers easier

**5. Employee Stock Options (ESOPs)**:
- Attract talent with equity participation
- Public listing makes ESOPs valuable (tradeable)

---

### Types of IPOs

**1. Fixed Price IPO** (Rare now, &lt;5%):
- Company decides price upfront (e.g., ₹100 per share)
- Investors apply at that price
- No bidding
- Simple but less market-driven

**2. Book Building IPO** (95% of modern IPOs):
- Company provides price band (e.g., ₹500-₹525)
- Investors bid within or above band
- Final price determined by demand
- More market-efficient

**3. Fresh Issue**:
- Company issues NEW shares
- Money goes to company
- Dilutes existing shareholders

**4. Offer For Sale (OFS)**:
- Existing shareholders sell their shares
- Money goes to selling shareholders (promoters, VCs)
- No dilution, no fresh capital to company

**Most IPOs**: Combination of Fresh Issue + OFS

---

## 2. The IPO Journey: Step-by-Step (SEBI Framework)

### Step 1: Hiring Investment Bankers (Merchant Bankers)

**Company appoints** (typically 2-5 banks):
- Book Running Lead Managers (BRLMs): Investment banks (ICICI Securities, Kotak Investment Banking, Axis Capital, etc.)
- Legal advisors
- Auditors
- Registrar (for allotment processing)

**Their roles**:
- **Valuation**: Determine company worth, suggest price band
- **Due diligence**: Verify financials, legal compliance
- **DRHP drafting**: Prepare disclosure document
- **Marketing**: Roadshows to institutional investors
- **Book building**: Manage bidding process

**Fees**: 2-4% of funds raised (₹200-400 Cr on ₹10,000 Cr IPO)

---

### Step 2: Filing DRHP (Draft Red Herring Prospectus)

**DRHP** = Detailed disclosure document filed with SEBI

**Contains** (200-500 pages typically):
1. **Company Overview**: Business model, products, history
2. **Financials**: Last 3 years audited (revenue, profit, debt)
3. **Objects of the Issue**: Where money will be used
4. **Risk Factors**: Business risks, regulatory risks, market risks
5. **Management**: Promoters, board, key personnel
6. **Industry Overview**: Market size, competition
7. **Outstanding Litigations**: Ongoing legal cases
8. **Related Party Transactions**: Deals with promoter entities
9. **Basis of Issue Price**: Valuation methodology

**"Red Herring"** = Price not finalized yet (will be determined via book building)

**Public availability**: DRHP posted on SEBI website, company website, stock exchange sites

**Investor duty**: READ DRHP (at minimum: financials, risk factors, use of proceeds)

---

### Step 3: SEBI Approval

**SEBI reviews** (21-30 days typically):
- Completeness of disclosure
- Compliance with SEBI ICDR Regulations
- No misleading statements
- Risk factors adequately mentioned

**SEBI does NOT**:
- Verify accuracy of claims
- Endorse company quality
- Guarantee returns

**SEBI approval** = "Disclosures are adequate for investors to make informed decision"

**NOT** = "This is a good investment"

**Outcome**: Observations letter from SEBI (required changes), company files updated DRHP

---

### Step 4: Price Band Announcement & Roadshows

**Price Band**:
- Company announces range (e.g., ₹500-₹525)
- Maximum 20% spread allowed
- Published in RHP (Red Herring Prospectus—post SEBI observations)

**Institutional Roadshows** (1-2 weeks before IPO opens):
- BRLMs present company to QIBs (Qualified Institutional Buyers): mutual funds, insurance, foreign investors
- Gauge demand, get feedback on valuation
- Anchor investor bidding (1 day before public opening)

---

### Step 5: IPO Subscription Period (Bidding)

**Duration**: Minimum 3 working days (can be extended to 10 days)

**Investor Categories** (SEBI mandated quotas):

| Category | Quota | Max Application | Allotment Basis |
|----------|-------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **QIBs** (Mutual Funds, FIIs) | 50% | Unlimited | Proportional |
| **NIIs** (High Net-Worth) | 15% | >₹2 lakh to ₹10 lakh | Proportional |
| **Retail** (Individual investors) | 35% | Up to ₹2 lakh | Lottery if oversubscribed |

**Retail Application**:
- Minimum: 1 lot (company defines lot size, e.g., 10 shares)
- Maximum: ₹2 lakh worth
- Can apply in 3 bid slots (at different price points within band)

**Cut-off Price Option**: Retail investors can bid at "cut-off" = agree to pay whatever final price is determined

---

### Step 6: Price Discovery (Book Building)

**After 3 days of bidding**:

**Demand aggregation**:
- Total bids across all categories counted
- Demand at each price point analyzed

**Final price determination**:
- Typically at higher end of band (if demand strong)
- Or at cut-off determined by QIB demand
- 50% QIB quota must be subscribed, else IPO fails

**Subscription numbers** (published daily):

"IPO subscribed 10x"
- Retail: 15x (₹100 Cr quota, ₹1,500 Cr applications)
- NII: 8x
- QIB: 5x

**High subscription ≠ Good company** (just means hype/overvaluation often)

---

### Step 7: Allotment

**Basis of Allotment** (decided by Registrar, approved by stock exchanges):

**If undersubscribed** (&lt;1x):
- Everyone gets full allotment
- Rare (usually bad sign)

**If oversubscribed**:

**QIB & NII**: Proportional
- If subscribed 10x, everyone gets 10% of what they applied for

**Retail**: Lottery + Proportional
- Minimum lot guaranteed to some applicants (lottery)
- Remaining shares proportionally distributed

**Example** (Retail quota ₹100 Cr, applications ₹300 Cr, 15,000 applicants):

**Step 1**: Allocate 1 lot each to 10,000 applicants (lottery)
**Step 2**: Remaining shares distributed proportionally to all

**Allotment finalized**: ~7 days after IPO close

**Refunds**: Excess amount (if partial allotment) refunded to bank account within 7 days

---

### Step 8: Listing Day

**Shares credited to Demat account**: T+3 days (3 working days after allotment)

**Listing on NSE/BSE**: Same day

**Opening price** (discovered via pre-open auction):
- 8:00-9:00 AM: Orders placed
- No trading, only order book buildup
- 9:00 AM: Equilibrium price calculated
- 9:15 AM: Trading begins

**Listing Gains/Losses**:
- If opening > issue price: Listing gain (e.g., issue ₹100, opens ₹130 = 30% gain)
- If opening < issue price: Listing loss (e.g., issue ₹100, opens ₹85 = 15% loss)

**First day circuit limits**: ±20% (stock can't move beyond this range on listing day)

---

## 3. How to Evaluate an IPO (Fundamental Lens)

### Read the DRHP: Critical Sections

**1. Risk Factors** (usually first 20-30 pages):

Red flags:
- "Company has never been profitable"
- "Dependent on single customer for 60% revenue"
- "Promoter pledged shares"
- "Outstanding litigation ₹500 Cr"
- "Regulatory uncertainty in our sector"

**Example** (Paytm DRHP, 2021):
- "We have a history of net losses"
- "Our profitability is uncertain"
- **But retail investors ignored, applied for "listing gains"**

---

**2. Financials** (last 3 years):

**Check**:

| Metric | What to Look For |
|--------|------------------|
| Revenue Growth | Consistent 20%+ YoY |
| Profitability | EBITDA margin improving, PAT positive (or clear path) |
| Debt | Debt-to-Equity &lt;1, interest coverage >3x |
| Cash Flow | Positive operating cash flow |
| Return on Equity | RoE >15% for mature companies |

**Red flags**:
- Declining revenue (unless turnaround story with evidence)
- Negative cash flow for 3 consecutive years
- Debt increasing faster than revenue
- One-time profit from asset sale (not sustainable)

**Example** (Zomato IPO, 2021):
- Revenue: ₹1,994 Cr (2020), growing
- Loss: ₹816 Cr (but improving from ₹2,385 Cr in 2019)
- **High-growth, path to profitability visible → Reasonable bet despite losses**

---

**3. Objects of the Issue** (where money goes):

**Good uses**:
- Capacity expansion (new manufacturing plants)
- R&D investments
- Technology upgrades
- Working capital (reasonable amount, 20-30%)
- Debt repayment (if debt-heavy, this reduces interest burden)

**Bad uses**:
- >70% going to Offer For Sale (money to selling shareholders, not company)
- "General corporate purposes" (vague, no clear plan)
- Related party transactions (promoter companies getting money)

**Example** (LIC IPO, 2022):
- 100% Offer For Sale (₹21,000 Cr)
- Zero fresh capital to LIC
- All money went to Government of India (selling shareholder)
- **LIC got ZERO benefit from IPO → Stock price stagnant**

---

**4. Valuation Metrics**:

**Compare to listed peers**:

| Company | P/E Ratio | P/B Ratio | Price-to-Sales |
|---------|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| IPO Company | 50x | 8x | 12x |
| Peer 1 (Listed) | 30x | 5x | 6x |
| Peer 2 (Listed) | 35x | 6x | 7x |

**If IPO priced at 50% premium to peers** → Overvalued (listing loss likely)

**Example** (Paytm):
- Priced at 40x Price-to-Sales
- Listed fintech companies: 10-15x P/S
- **2.5-4x premium → Expensive**

---

**5. Promoter Holding Post-IPO**:

**Good sign**: Promoters retain 60%+ (confident in business)
**Red flag**: Promoters selling to &lt;40% (trying to exit)

**Lock-in period**: Promoters must hold shares for 3 years post-listing (SEBI rule)

---

### Grey Market Premium (GMP): Use with Caution

**What is GMP?**

Unofficial market where IPO shares are traded BEFORE listing

**How it works**:
- Broker/dealer quotes "premium" (e.g., GMP = +₹50)
- If issue price ₹500, GMP ₹50 → Expected listing ₹550
- Investors can "sell" allotment (if they get it) for ₹550 - ₹500 = ₹50 profit per share

**Problems**:
1. **Illegal**: Not regulated, no legal recourse
2. **Speculative**: Based on sentiment, not fundamentals
3. **Manipulated**: Operators inflate GMP to create hype
4. **Wrong often**: Paytm had +₹50 GMP, listed -₹200 below issue

**Our view**: Ignore GMP completely. Focus on fundamentals.

---

## 4. Risks in IPO Investing

### Risk 1: Overvaluation at Peak

**Pattern** (historical):
- Bull market peak → Companies rush to list
- High valuations (founders want to maximize proceeds)
- Retail frenzy (everyone wants "listing gains")
- **Market corrects 6-12 months later → IPO stocks crash hardest**

**2021 Example**: 63 IPOs listed, average first-year return: -15%

**Paytm, Zomato, Nykaa, PB Fintech (PolicyBazaar)** all listed at peak valuations, fell 40-70% in next 12 months

---

### Risk 2: Information Asymmetry

**Company knows more than you**:
- Why listing NOW? (Peak valuations? Issues ahead?)
- Which financials to highlight (revenue growth), which to hide (negative cash flow)
- Optimistic projections in DRHP (no accountability)

**Retail investor**: Limited time, expertise to analyze 400-page DRHP

**Investment banks**: Incentivized to maximize IPO price (their fees depend on it)

---

### Risk 3: Lock-In Cannot Sell Easily

**Listing day lock-in**: If you get allotment but stock not credited yet, you can't sell (T+3 delay)

**Example**: Stock opens at +50%, you want to book profit, but shares not in Demat → Can't sell → Next 2 days stock falls to -10% → Opportunity lost

---

### Risk 4: Anchor Investor Dumping

**Anchor investors** (mutual funds, FIIs):
- Get 30-60% of QIB quota one day before public offer
- Lock-in: Only 30 days (vs 3 years for promoters)
- **Often sell after 30 days** → Supply pressure → Price falls

**Check**: Anchor investor list (published in allotment), see if quality investors (long-term mutual funds) or flippers

---

### Risk 5: Regulatory / Sector Risk

**New sectors** (fintech, edtech, crypto):
- Regulatory framework unclear
- Government policy can change overnight
- Example: RBI restricting Paytm Payments Bank (2024) → Stock crashed 40% in weeks

---

## 5. Common Mistakes & Misconceptions

### Mistake 1: "IPO = Easy Listing Gains"

**Reality**: 60-70% IPOs give negative returns in first year

**Data** (BSE IPO performance, 2015-2023):
- 1-year average return: -8%
- 3-year average return: +12% (survivors only)
- **Many IPOs never recovered issue price even after 5 years**

**Listing gains are exception, not rule**

---

### Mistake 2: "High Subscription = Good Company"

**Oversubscription** = Demand > Supply

**But**:
- Retail applies blindly (heard from friend, saw ad)
- QIBs apply for multiple IPOs, may not get allotment
- High subscription can be due to small issue size, not quality

**Example** (Small IPO, ₹50 Cr retail quota):
- Subscribed 50x (₹2,500 Cr applications)
- Sounds impressive
- But only 2% get allotment → Everyone sells on listing day → Price crashes

**Low subscription can indicate smart money avoiding (overvalued)**

---

### Mistake 3: "Government Company IPO = Safe"

**LIC, IRCTC, RVNL** examples:
- Government ownership ≠ Good stock performance
- Often overpriced (government wants to maximize revenue)
- Post-listing, stock behaves like any other (no special protection)

**LIC**: ₹949 issue, ₹875 listing, ₹600-700 for next 18 months

---

### Mistake 4: "Apply for Multiple Accounts (Family Members)"

**Problem**: If all get allotment, you're overinvested in one stock

**Better**: Apply for ₹2 lakh max in one account, diversify across multiple IPOs instead

---

### Myth: "Retail Quota Gives Better Allotment Chances"

**Reality**: If subscribed 10x+, your allotment chance is ~10%

**Better odds in undersubscribed IPOs** (but those are usually bad quality)

---

## 6. Long-Term Investor Perspective

### When to Apply for IPO

**Apply IF**:
1. ✅ Business model you understand
2. ✅ Strong financials (revenue growth, improving margins, low debt)
3. ✅ Reasonable valuation (at or below listed peers)
4. ✅ Capital usage clear and productive (growth, not just OFS)
5. ✅ You're willing to hold 3-5 years (ignore listing price)

**Avoid IF**:
1. ❌ "Everyone is applying" (herd mentality)
2. ❌ Expecting listing gains (speculation)
3. ❌ Valuations 50%+ above peers
4. ❌ Company never been profitable with no clear path
5. ❌ You haven't read DRHP

---

### Post-Listing Strategy

**If you get allotment**:

**Option A: Sell on listing** (if 20%+ gain)
- Book profit
- Reassess company fundamentally
- If still attractive, buy back later at lower price

**Option B: Hold if conviction**
- Ignore first 3-6 months volatility
- Review quarterly results
- Add if price falls 20-30% (if fundamentals intact)

**Option C: Sell if listing loss**
- Accept mistake
- Redeploy capital to better opportunities
- Don't "hold hoping to recover" if fundamentals weak

---

## 7. How to Apply for IPO (Step-by-Step)

**Prerequisites**:
1. Demat account (with NSDL/CDSL)
2. Trading account (with broker)

---

## 8. Practical Implications

### For a Conservative Investor (40+ Age)

**Approach**: Avoid most IPOs

**Rationale**:
- IPOs are volatile (30-50% swings)
- Information asymmetry (promoters know more)
- Better to wait 1-2 years, see quarterly results, then invest if company proves itself

**Exception**: High-quality PSU IPOs at reasonable valuations (IREDA, NHPC types) for long-term hold

---

### For an Aggressive Investor (20-35 Age)

**Approach**: Apply selectively, portfolio approach

**Strategy**:
- Apply for 5-10 IPOs per year (after DRHP reading)
- Expect allotment in 2-3 (due to oversubscription)
- Sell 1-2 on listing if gains >20%
- Hold 1-2 for long-term
- **Portfolio approach**: Some losers, some winners, average return hopefully positive

**Allocation**: &lt;10% of equity portfolio in IPOs (high risk)

## 10. FAQs

**Q1: Can I make money from IPOs?**

**Answer**: Possible, but NOT easy or guaranteed.

**Data** (2015-2023 BSE IPOs):
- Listing day positive: ~55% (slight edge)
- 1-year positive: ~40% (below coin flip)
- 3-year positive: ~50% (survivors only; many delisted)

**Listing gains mindset is gambling, not investing**

**Better approach**: Apply only to companies you'd hold 5 years

---

**Q2: Should I apply for every IPO to maximize chances?**

**No**. Quality over quantity.

**Better**: Apply to 3-5 well-researched IPOs than 20 blindly

**Math**: If you apply to 10 IPOs, get allotment in 2 (20% chance due to oversubscription):
- 1 might list +30%
- 1 might list -20%
- Net: +5% (but tied capital for weeks, refund delays)

**Vs**: Apply to 2 high-conviction IPOs, get 1 allotment, hold long-term

---

**Q3: What is "anchor investor" and why does it matter?**

**Answer**: Large institutions who get guaranteed allotment before public opening

**Significance**:
- If top mutual funds (HDFC MF, ICICI Pru, SBI MF) are anchors → Positive signal (they did due diligence)
- If only foreign/unknown funds → Weaker signal
- Check lock-in: 30 days → Many dump after lock-in (price pressure)

**Where to find**: Anchor investor list published on stock exchange websites 1 day before IPO opens

---

**Q4: If IPO is undersubscribed, should I apply more?**

**Usually NO**. Undersubscription = smart money avoiding.

**Reasons for undersubscription**:
- Overpriced
- Weak business model
- Bad market conditions
- Poor financials

**Exception**: Market crash, all IPOs undersubscribed → Might find value

**But**: Undersubscribed IPOs often list flat or negative (no demand)

---

**Q5: Can I sell IPO shares on listing day itself?**

**Yes**, but only if shares credited to Demat by market open (9:15 AM)

**T+3 settlement**: Shares credited 3 working days after allotment finalization

**Timing risk**: 
- Allotment on Monday → Shares credited Thursday → Can sell Thursday onward
- If listing on Thursday but shares not yet credited → Cannot sell

**Pro tip**: Check "Demat holdings" before market open on listing day

---

**Q6: Is grey market premium (GMP) a reliable indicator?**

**No. Absolutely not.**

**GMP failures**:
- Paytm: GMP +₹50 → Listed -₹200 below issue
- LIC: GMP +₹30 → Listed -₹75
- Many small IPOs: GMP manipulated by operators to create hype

**GMP works when**: 
- Strong fundamentals + reasonable valuation + bull market
- But in those cases, you don't need GMP—fundamentals are enough

**Ignore GMP. Read DRHP.**

---

## Conclusion: IPOs Aren't Lottery Tickets

IPOs are NOT:
- ❌ Guaranteed listing gains
- ❌ Risk-free investments
- ❌ Shortcuts to quick wealth
- ❌ Suitable for speculation

IPOs ARE:
- ✅ Opportunity to invest in growth companies early
- ✅ Require rigorous fundamental analysis (DRHP reading)
- ✅ High-risk, high-volatility instruments
- ✅ Best approached with long-term (3-5 year) perspective
- ✅ Portfolio diversification tool (&lt;10% allocation)

**The retail investor tragedy**:
- Applies to 20 IPOs blindly
- Reads WhatsApp forwards, ignores DRHP
- Expects listing gains on all
- Gets allotment in 3
- 2 list negative, 1 lists positive
- Sells winner immediately, holds losers "hoping to recover"
- **Net result: Losses**

**The smart investor approach**:
- Applies to 3 IPOs after thorough research
- Reads DRHP (at least risk factors, financials, use of proceeds)
- Gets allotment in 1
- Holds for 3-5 years if fundamentals strong
- Ignores listing day volatility
- Reviews quarterly results
- **Net result: Compound wealth if company succeeds**

**Remember**:
- 60% of IPOs underperform market in first year
- Promoters list at peak valuations (favorable to them, not you)
- Investment banks want high price (their fees depend on it)
- **You are at information disadvantage**

**But**:
- Some IPOs (Zomato, Avenue Supermarts, HDFC Life) created massive wealth
- Early investors (who held) made 5-10x returns over 5-10 years
- Key was patience + fundamental quality

**Action plan**:

**This week**:
1. Open Demat account (if you don't have)
2. Enable UPI payment for IPO applications
3. Bookmark SEBI website, Chittorgarh IPO portal (for DRHP links)

**When next IPO comes**:
4. Download DRHP (300-500 pages)
5. Read: Risk factors (first 30 pages), Financials (10 pages), Objects of Issue (5 pages)
6. Compare valuation to listed peers (30 minutes research)
7. Ask: "Would I hold this stock for 5 years?" If NO → Don't apply

**If allotted**:
8. Don't obsess over listing price
9. Review company quarterly results
10. Sell if fundamentals deteriorate (management change, revenue decline, debt increase)
11. Hold if thesis intact

**IPOs aren't lottery tickets. They're businesses going public.**

**Treat them as long-term investments, not speculation.**

**Your financial future deserves better than GMP and WhatsApp forwards.**
