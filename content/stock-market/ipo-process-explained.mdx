# IPO Process Explained

An **Initial Public Offering (IPO)** is when a private company sells shares to the public for the first time. It's a major milestone for any company.

## The IPO Journey

### 1. Hiring Investment Bankers
The company hires experts (Merchant Bankers) to manage the process, value the company, and market the IPO.

### 2. Filing DRHP (Draft Red Herring Prospectus)
The company files a detailed document with SEBI. The DRHP contains:
*   Financial statements
*   Business model
*   Risks involved
*   Why they are raising money

### 3. SEBI Approval
SEBI reviews the DRHP to ensure all disclosures are made. Once approved, the company can launch the IPO.

### 4. Price Band & Roadshow
The company decides the price range (e.g., ₹500 - ₹525) and markets the IPO to institutional investors.

### 5. Bidding (The IPO Open Date)
The IPO opens for 3 days. Investors (Retail, HNI, QIB) place their bids.
*   **Retail Quota:** Usually 35% of the issue is reserved for retail investors.

### 6. Allotment & Listing
*   **Allotment:** Shares are assigned to investors (often via lottery if oversubscribed).
*   **Listing:** The shares start trading on NSE and BSE.

## Should You Invest in an IPO?

**Pros:**
*   Chance to buy early into a growth story.
*   Listing gains (if the market sentiment is good).

**Cons:**
*   Valuations can be expensive.
*   Limited historical data as a public company.

## Conclusion

Read the DRHP (at least the risk factors) before investing. Don't just invest for "listing gains."
