# Recession & Business Cycles

Economies do not grow in a straight line. They move in cycles of expansion and contraction. Understanding these **business cycles** is key to navigating the financial world.

## Phases of a Business Cycle

1.  **Expansion:** The economy is growing, employment is high, and consumer spending is robust.
2.  **Peak:** The economy hits its maximum limit. Inflation pressures may build up.
3.  **Contraction (Recession):** Economic activity slows down. GDP declines, and unemployment rises.
4.  **Trough:** The bottom of the cycle. The economy stops shrinking and begins to recover.

## What is a Recession?

A common definition of a recession is **two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth**. However, economists also look at other indicators like employment, industrial production, and retail sales.

### Causes of Recession

*   **High Interest Rates:** To fight inflation, central banks raise rates, which can slow down the economy too much.
*   **Asset Bubbles:** When bubbles (like housing or dot-com) burst, wealth evaporates, leading to a pullback in spending.
*   **External Shocks:** Events like pandemics, wars, or oil price spikes can trigger a recession.

## How to Prepare for a Recession

1.  **Build an Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have 6-12 months of expenses saved.
2.  **Reduce Debt:** Pay off high-interest debt to improve your cash flow.
3.  **Diversify Income:** Don't rely on a single source of income.
4.  **Stay Invested:** Markets often recover before the economy does. Avoid panic selling.

## Conclusion

Recessions are a natural part of the economic cycle. While they can be painful, they also clear out inefficiencies and set the stage for the next phase of growth.
