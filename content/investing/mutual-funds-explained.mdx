Mutual funds have become one of the most popular investment vehicles in India, with Assets Under Management (AUM) crossing ₹50 lakh crore. Whether you're a first-time investor or looking to diversify your portfolio, understanding mutual funds is essential for building long-term wealth.

## What is a Mutual Fund?

A **mutual fund** is a professionally managed investment vehicle that pools money from multiple investors to invest in a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other securities.

### How Mutual Funds Work

1. **Pooling**: Investors contribute money to a common fund
2. **Professional Management**: Fund managers invest the pooled money
3. **Diversification**: Money is spread across multiple securities
4. **NAV Calculation**: Fund value divided by units = Net Asset Value
5. **Returns Distribution**: Gains/losses shared proportionally among investors

### Key Terms to Know

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| NAV | Net Asset Value - price per unit of the fund |
| AUM | Assets Under Management - total value of fund |
| Expense Ratio | Annual fee charged as % of AUM |
| Load | Entry (front-end) or exit (back-end) charges |
| SIP | Systematic Investment Plan - regular investments |

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How much should I invest in mutual funds?
As a thumb rule, invest at least 20-30% of your income. For specific goals, calculate the required corpus and work backward to determine monthly SIP amount.

### Are mutual funds safe?
Mutual funds carry market risk, but diversification reduces individual security risk. Debt funds are generally safer than equity. Choose funds matching your risk tolerance.

### What is the best mutual fund for beginners?
Large cap equity funds or balanced advantage funds are good starting points for beginners due to lower volatility and professional management.

### Can I lose money in mutual funds?
Yes, especially in equity funds during market corrections. However, historically, equity funds have given positive returns over 5+ year periods. Time in market reduces risk.

### How is mutual fund NAV calculated?
NAV = (Total Assets - Total Liabilities) / Number of Outstanding Units. It's calculated daily after market close.

### When should I redeem my mutual fund investment?
Redeem when you've achieved your goal, when your investment thesis changes significantly, or during portfolio rebalancing. Avoid panic selling during market corrections.

### What is the difference between growth and dividend options?
Growth option reinvests all gains, compounding your wealth. Dividend option (now called IDCW) pays out gains periodically. Growth is better for wealth building; IDCW for regular income needs.

### How many mutual funds should I own?
5-8 funds across different categories is usually sufficient for diversification. More funds often lead to over-diversification without additional benefit.
