## Understanding Stock Market Fundamentals

2. **Company Performance** - Revenue, profits, and growth prospects
3. **Market Sentiment** - Investor psychology and market trends
4. **Economic Factors** - Interest rates, inflation, <GlossaryTooltip term="GDP" definition="Gross Domestic Product - the total value of goods and services produced in a country">GDP</GlossaryTooltip> growth

|-----------|---------|------------|
| **Moving Averages (50, 200 day)** | Trend identification | Buy when price > MA, Sell when price < MA |
| **RSI (Relative Strength Index)** | Momentum | <30 = Oversold, >70 = Overbought |
| **MACD** | Trend + Momentum | Bullish when MACD crosses above signal line |

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
<summary>**How much money do I need to start investing in stocks?**</summary>

You can start with as little as ₹500-₹1,000. Many brokers offer zero brokerage on delivery trades. However, having ₹5,000-₹10,000 allows better diversification across 3-5 stocks or index funds.
</details>

<details>
<summary>**Is stock market investing risky?**</summary>

Yes, stock markets carry inherent risk, but risk decreases with:
- Longer investment horizon (5+ years)
- Proper diversification
- Fundamental research
- Disciplined approach

Historical data shows long-term equity investments have beaten inflation consistently.
</details>

<details>
<summary>**Should I invest in stocks or mutual funds?**</summary>

**Direct Stocks:** If you have time for research, can track markets, and want control  
**Mutual Funds:** If you prefer professional management, want instant diversification, or are just starting

Many investors do both - index funds for core (60-70%) + individual stocks for satellite (30-40%).
</details>

<details>
<summary>**What is the best time of day to buy stocks?**</summary>

- **9:15-9:45 AM:** High volatility, avoid impulsive trades
- **11:00 AM-2:00 PM:** More stable, good for analysis
- **2:00-3:30 PM:** End-of-day movements, institutional activity

For long-term investors, timing the day matters less than timing the price and fundamentals.
</details>

<details>
<summary>**How do I know if a stock is overvalued?**</summary>

Check these indicators:
- P/E ratio significantly above sector average
- Price growing faster than earnings
- Very high P/B ratio (>5)
- Promoter selling / institutional exits
- Unsustainable business model

Always compare valuation within the same sector.
</details>

<details>
<summary>**Should I invest in IPOs?**</summary>

IPOs can be lucrative but risky:

**Pros:** Listing gains, early entry, long-term growth potential  
**Cons:** No historical data, often overpriced, lock-in periods

**Tips:** Read DRHP document, check fundamentals, avoid oversubscribed hype, consider anchor investor quality.
</details>

<details>
<summary>**How much return can I expect from stock market?**</summary>

**Realistic expectations:**
- **Nifty 50 (10-year average):** 12-15% CAGR
- **Good stock picking:** 15-20% CAGR possible
- **Exceptional investors:** 20%+ CAGR (very rare)

Remember: Returns are not linear. Expect ups and downs. Past performance doesn't guarantee future returns.
</details>

<details>
<summary>**What is the difference between NSE and BSE?**</summary>

Both are Indian stock exchanges:

**NSE (National Stock Exchange):**
- More liquid, higher trading volumes
- Nifty 50 index
- Preferred for F&O trading

**BSE (Bombay Stock Exchange):**
- Asia's oldest exchange (1875)
- Sensex index
- More listed companies (5,000+)

You can trade on both via your broker. NSE is generally preferred for active trading.
