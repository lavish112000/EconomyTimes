# Risk Management & Diversification

Investing without risk management is like driving without brakes. You might go fast, but a crash will be fatal.

## What is Diversification?

Diversification means spreading your investments across different assets to reduce risk.
*   **Asset Class Diversification:** Stocks, Bonds, Gold, Real Estate.
*   **Sector Diversification:** Banking, IT, Pharma, Auto.
*   **Geographic Diversification:** India, US, Emerging Markets.

## Why Diversify?

1.  **Reduces Volatility:** When stocks fall, gold or bonds might rise, balancing your portfolio.
2.  **Protects Capital:** Even if one company goes bankrupt, your overall portfolio survives.
3.  **Smoother Returns:** You get more consistent returns over time.

## Asset Allocation Strategies

### 1. Age-Based Rule
*   **Equity Allocation = 100 - Age**
*   If you are 30, invest 70% in Equity and 30% in Debt.

### 2. The 60/40 Portfolio
*   60% in Stocks (Growth)
*   40% in Bonds (Stability)
*   A classic strategy that has worked for decades.

### 3. Core & Satellite
*   **Core (80%):** Index Funds & Large Cap Funds (Safe, steady).
*   **Satellite (20%):** Small Caps, Sector Funds, or Direct Stocks (High risk, high reward).

## Conclusion

"Diversification is the only free lunch in investing." It allows you to reduce risk without necessarily reducing expected returns.
