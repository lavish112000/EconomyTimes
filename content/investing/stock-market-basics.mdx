The stock market offers one of the most powerful wealth creation opportunities available to ordinary individuals. Understanding how it works is the first step toward building long-term wealth. This comprehensive guide covers everything a beginner needs to know about stock market investing in India.

## What is a Stock Market?

A **stock market** is a marketplace where shares of publicly traded companies are bought and sold. It's a platform that brings together buyers (investors) and sellers (companies or other investors).

### Key Functions of Stock Market

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How much money do I need to start investing in stocks?
You can start with as little as the price of one share. Some stocks are available for under ₹100. However, for meaningful diversification, starting with ₹10,000-50,000 is recommended.

### Is stock market investing risky?
Yes, stocks carry risk of capital loss, especially in short term. However, historically, equity has outperformed other asset classes over long periods (10+ years). Risk can be managed through diversification and long-term investing.

### Should I invest in stocks directly or through mutual funds?
Beginners often benefit from starting with mutual funds (professional management, diversification). Once you understand markets better, you can explore direct stock investing for specific companies you like.

### How do I know when to sell a stock?
Sell when: (1) Your investment thesis changes, (2) Better opportunities exist, (3) You need rebalancing, (4) You've reached your target price. Avoid selling purely due to fear during market corrections.

### What is the best time to invest in stocks?
Time in market beats timing the market. Start investing when you have surplus funds and a long-term horizon. SIP helps avoid timing decisions by investing regularly regardless of market levels.

### Can I lose all my money in stocks?
While individual stocks can go to zero (bankruptcy), a diversified portfolio is unlikely to lose everything. Large, established companies rarely go bankrupt. Diversification protects against catastrophic loss.

### How are stock prices determined?
Stock prices are determined by supply and demand. When more people want to buy (demand) than sell (supply), prices rise. Company performance, economic conditions, and investor sentiment all influence demand.

### What is the difference between NSE and BSE?
Both are stock exchanges where shares are traded. NSE is newer (1992), fully electronic, and has Nifty as its index. BSE is older (1875) and has Sensex. Most stocks are listed on both exchanges.
