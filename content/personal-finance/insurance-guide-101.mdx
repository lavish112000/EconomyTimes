# Insurance Guide 101

Insurance is not an investment; it is a risk management tool. Before you start investing for wealth creation, you must secure your financial foundation with adequate insurance.

## 1. Health Insurance (Mediclaim)

With rising medical costs, a single hospitalization can wipe out your savings.

### Key Features to Look For:
*   **No Room Rent Capping:** Ensure your policy doesn't limit the room rent, as this affects other charges too.
*   **Pre & Post Hospitalization:** Covers expenses incurred before admission and after discharge.
*   **No Co-payment:** Avoid policies where you have to pay a percentage of the bill.
*   **Restoration Benefit:** Refills your sum insured if it gets exhausted during the year.

## 2. Term Life Insurance

This is the purest form of life insurance. It provides a large cover for a small premium.

### Why Term Insurance?
*   **High Cover, Low Cost:** You can get a cover of ₹1 Crore for as low as ₹10-15k per year (depending on age).
*   **Financial Security:** Ensures your family can maintain their lifestyle and pay off debts in your absence.
*   **Tax Benefits:** Premiums are eligible for deduction under Section 80C.

### Term vs. Endowment/ULIPs
Avoid mixing insurance with investment. Endowment plans and ULIPs often offer low returns and inadequate cover. **Buy Term and Invest the Rest.**

## 3. Personal Accident & Disability Cover

Often overlooked, this covers you against temporary or permanent disability due to accidents, ensuring income continuity.

## Conclusion

Treat insurance as an expense for your safety, not an investment for returns. A robust insurance portfolio protects your wealth from unforeseen events.
