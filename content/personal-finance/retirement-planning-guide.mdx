# Retirement Planning

Retirement planning is about ensuring financial independence when you no longer have a regular salary. The biggest enemy of retirement planning is **inflation**.

## The Power of Compounding

Starting early is the cheat code.
*   **Start at 25:** Invest ₹5k/month @ 12% → ₹3.2 Cr at 60.
*   **Start at 35:** Invest ₹5k/month @ 12% → ₹95 Lakhs at 60.
*   **Cost of Delay:** A 10-year delay costs you over ₹2 Crores!

## Retirement Investment Options in India

### 1. Employees' Provident Fund (EPF)
*   **For:** Salaried employees.
*   **Returns:** ~8.15% (Government backed).
*   **Tax:** EEE (Exempt-Exempt-Exempt) status up to limits.

### 2. Public Provident Fund (PPF)
*   **For:** Everyone.
*   **Returns:** ~7.1% (Tax-free).
*   **Lock-in:** 15 years.
*   **Safety:** Sovereign guarantee.

### 3. National Pension System (NPS)
*   **For:** Everyone.
*   **Returns:** Market-linked (Equity + Debt).
*   **Tax:** Additional ₹50k deduction under 80CCD(1B).
*   **Flexibility:** Choose your asset allocation.

### 4. Equity Mutual Funds
*   **For:** Long-term growth.
*   **Returns:** 12-15% potential over long term.
*   **Risk:** High volatility in short term.
*   **Strategy:** Best for building the accumulation phase corpus.

## The 4% Rule

A general rule of thumb is that you can withdraw 4% of your retirement corpus annually without running out of money for 30 years.
*   **Example:** If you need ₹12 Lakhs/year in retirement, you need a corpus of ₹3 Crores.

## Conclusion

Don't rely solely on one instrument. A mix of EPF/PPF for stability and NPS/Mutual Funds for growth is the ideal strategy.
